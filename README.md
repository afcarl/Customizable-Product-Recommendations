# Customizable-Product-Recommendations

This is the code that myself and my friend Aravind Sivaramakrishnan wrote for our pet project during our senior year at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham (University), Coimbatore. We were grateful to work under Dr. Vidhya Balasubramanian and her guidance was amazing. We published this work at the 5th International Conference on Web Intelligence, Mining and Semantics at Larnaca, Cyprus in July 2015.

Abstract:
Recommender systems have become very prominent over the past decade. Methods such as collaborative filtering and knowledge based recommender systems have been developed extensively for non-customizable products. However, as manufacturers today are moving towards customizable products to satisfy customers, the need of the hour is customizable product recommender systems. Such systems must be able to capture customer preferences and provide recommendations that are both diverse and novel. This paper proposes an approach to building a recommender system that can be adapted to customizable products such as desktop computers and home theater systems. The Customizable Product Recommendation problem is modeled as a special case of the Multiple Choice Knapsack Problem, and an algorithm is proposed to generate desirable product recommendations in real-time. The performance of the proposed system is then evaluated.

This repository contains all the code and the datasets that we used for our project. We are thrilled by the fact that a batch of junior students at Amrita are working on extending this project for products which have interdependable features. We hope that this code will be useful to other programmers and researchers who want to refer to our work. 

<b>Note: After college, Aravind got busy with work and I went off to graduate school. It has taken us 6 months to put up the code here. At the moment, it is not neatly organized but we are in the process of organizing it and hopefully, we should be done with it soon. 

If you have queries, please feel free to contact either me or Aravind.</b>
